Collection of simple STEM games (single HTML files), fully AI-generated. Part of early exploration of web-friendly STEM games in SWE Capstone.

## Current Games

### RL Maze Game
Introduce students to machine learning by configuring parameters of an RL agent navigating a maze.

#### Model:
Gemini 3 Pro

#### Prompt(s): 
1) "I want to create a stem education game targeted for high school students, in the field of AI/ML. The game should be simple enough to simply run as a single HTML file, while engaging and educational enough for students to play as a pre-lab for their class. perform research on this task, and come up with a game idea that can be coded in a single HTML game file."
2) "Go ahead and create this game, incorporating your ideas. Generate a single HTML file that runs your idea completely."


### Sensor Networks Game
Introduce students to connecting multiple sensors to operate actuators, depending on the task.

#### Model:
Gemini 3 Pro

#### Prompt(s): 
1) "Now, develop an idea for a game which incorporates sensors (possibly IoT). This game should provide students a warmup on sensor networks; preferably, this game should allow students to try constructing their own networks to perform a task. These tasks can either be level based (where they connect sensors to solve the problem), or a sandbox mode can be provided, depending on which is likely to provide a better learning experience. Share this concept with me, then build the game in a single html file."
